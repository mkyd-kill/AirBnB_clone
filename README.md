# AirBnB Clone Project

## Background Context
### Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!
Before starting, please read the AirBnB concept page.

<b>First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.</b>
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Each task is linked and will help you to:

1. put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
2. create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
3. create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
4. create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
5. create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

## What’s a command interpreter?
Do you remember the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

1. Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
2. Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
3. Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
4. Update attributes of an object
5. Destroy an object
